### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
* WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
